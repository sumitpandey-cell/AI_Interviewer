# Audio Processing Improvements

## Overview

This document summarizes the improvements made to the audio processing pipeline in the AI Interviewer system. These changes address the UnicodeDecodeError and binary audio data handling issues previously encountered.

## Key Improvements

1. **Robust Base64 Handling**: Added safe detection and decoding of base64-encoded audio data.

2. **Audio Format Auto-Detection**: Implemented format detection based on file signatures for WAV, WebM, MP3, and OGG.

3. **Audio Normalization**: Audio is now automatically normalized to 16kHz mono WAV format for consistent speech-to-text processing.

4. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling throughout the audio processing pipeline, with better error messages and fallbacks.

5. **Workflow Integration**: Updated the interview workflow to use the new audio processing utilities.

## Implementation Details

### New Utility Module: `audio_processing.py`

The new audio processing utility module offers:

- `detect_audio_format()`: Detects audio format from binary data
- `decode_audio_data()`: Decodes audio data that could be base64-encoded or raw bytes
- `normalize_audio()`: Converts audio to 16kHz mono WAV format
- `process_audio_data()`: Combines all the above functions into a single, easy-to-use function

### Updated `interviews/service.py`

The `submit_response()` method now:
- Uses the new `process_audio_data()` function to handle audio inputs
- Properly processes both base64-encoded strings and raw bytes
- Captures audio metadata and format information

### Updated `ai/workflow.py`

The `process_audio()` method now:
- Works with pre-processed audio data
- Uses the normalized audio format (16kHz mono WAV)
- Records audio processing metrics for monitoring

### Updated `ai/service.py` 

The `transcribe_audio_data()` method now:
- Has better defaults assuming audio has been normalized
- Is more resilient to audio format issues
- Provides better error messages

### Extended Schema: `interviews/schemas.py`

The `LangGraphState` schema has been extended with:
- `audio_metadata`: Stores metadata about the audio processing
- `audio_processing_metrics`: Captures processing success and statistics

## Testing

1. Created a simple test script (`test_simple_audio.py`) to verify:
   - Format detection for WAV, WebM, MP3, OGG
   - Base64 encoding/decoding
   - Audio normalization

2. Updated project tests to verify that audio processing works end-to-end.

## Benefits

1. **Robustness**: The system now handles a variety of audio formats and encodings.

2. **Consistency**: All audio is normalized to a standard format before processing.

3. **Monitoring**: Added metrics allow tracking of audio processing quality.

4. **Error Prevention**: UnicodeDecodeError and binary data handling issues are now prevented.

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding additional audio quality metrics (SNR, volume levels)

2. Implement audio caching to avoid redundant processing

3. Add audio filtering options for noise reduction

4. Consider integrating more advanced audio analysis features
